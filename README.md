### When to use Factory Design Pattern 
Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input one of the sub-class is expected to be returned.


Note:

In this post, I will demonstrate another creational pattern, i.e. Factory pattern, for creating instances for your classes. Factory, as the name suggests,
is a place to create some different products which are somehow similar in features yet divided into categories.

In Java, factory pattern is used to create instances of different classes of the same type.
